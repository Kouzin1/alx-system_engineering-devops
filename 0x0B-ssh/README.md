# SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Use a private key**
  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses  ssh  to connect to my ALX-provided server.

* **1. Create an SSH key pair**
  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
